      <b>Lorem</b> Ipsum is simply dummy text of <br />
      the <i>printing and typesetting</i> industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
      industry's <u>standard dummy</u> text ever since the 1500s, when an
      unknown printer <s>took a galley</s> of type and scrambled it to make a
      type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
      leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
      popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
      Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
      like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

      It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
      readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
      Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
      as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
      readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
      now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
      ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various
      versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
      purpose (injected humour and the like).
